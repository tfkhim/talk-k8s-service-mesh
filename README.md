This project contains slides and some demo resources for a meetup.

# Slides

The slides use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and are hosted at the
projects [GitHub page](https://tfkhim.github.io/talk-k8s-service-mesh).

## Local Development

The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a development server.
To start it switch to the `slides` folder and run the following command

    npm start

The slides can then be accessed at http://localhost:5173/talk-k8s-service-mesh. The dev server
will pick up any changes to the `slides/index.hml` and `slides/index.js`.
